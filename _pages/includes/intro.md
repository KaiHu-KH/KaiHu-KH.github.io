I am currently a senior research scientist of [Multimodal Intelligence Team]() in [Microsoft CoreAI]() <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style='width: 4em;'>, Seattle, US.

I am now working on Document Intelligence (DI), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [kaihu.kh@gmail.com](mailto:kaihu.kh@gmail.com). We are hiring interns!

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn/) and [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) in 2024, specializing in OCR, document layout analysis, and document understanding. My doctoral research was supervised by [Prof. Qiang Huo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/qianghuo/) at MSRA and [Prof. Jun Du](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jundu/) at USTC. During my Ph.D. studies, I was a research intern in the [Multi-Modal Interaction Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/speech/) at MSRA, where I worked on the [Microsoft OneOCR project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr) and the [Microsoft Document Intelligence project](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence) from 2018 to 2024 under the guidance of Researcher [Qiang Huo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/qianghuo/) and [Lei Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cUfOZxQAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my Ph.D., I received a B.S. degree in Physical Sciences and a dual B.Eng. degree in Computer Sciences from USTC in 2019.

My research interest includes OCR, Document Intelligence (DI), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). I have published 10+ papers at the top international AI jounals and conferences such as Pattern Recognition, AAAI, ICASSP, ICDAR.
